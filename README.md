# Home-Automation

Introduction:
This is a basic home automation system to switch lights on & off and check the doors' and windows' state from the Internet.

Hardware:
Arduino Mega 2560 Pro (for I/O)
ESP8266 NodeMCU WiFi Development Board (for webserver)
5V 16 Channel Relay Board Module

Operation:
With this system we can check the states and turn on and off the lights in the house. For example if I turned on the light in the living room with the pushbutton on the wall, the button on the website changes from OFF to ON without refreshing the webpage.
We also can check the doors' and windows' state, red means open, green means closed.
One more function is implemented already, if someone put somethin into the postbox we see that at the bottom of the website and email is sent to a specific address.
